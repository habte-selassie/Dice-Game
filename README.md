# Usage
To use the game, the player can simply open the HTML file containing the game in a web browser. The game interface will be displayed with two players named "Player 1" and "Player 2" and a "Roll Dice" button, a "Hold" button, and a "New Game" button.
The player can take turns clicking the "Roll Dice" button to roll a dice and accumulate points. If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and the other player takes their turn. If the player decides to "Hold", their accumulated points are added to their total score, and their turn ends.
The first player to reach a total score of 100 or more wins the game. The player can start a new game by clicking the "New Game" button at any time.
Note that the player can only roll the dice and hold their score while the game is still playing. Once a player wins, the game ends, and the player must start a new game.
